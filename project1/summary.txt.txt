For the testplan, I editted little bit from the hw6 because at that time I thought the cleanup() function is a function that user can choose. 
And, thus, I added to choose cleanup function in hw6's testplan. However, it's not the option that user can choose, so I just removed that from
test plan and editted the expected results little bit.

Basically, my code passes, or conditionally passes all the cases in the testplan. From the first row (test 1) to last row (test 43), I entered the
information exactly as it is in the testplan. While I was testing the testplan, I noticed that I didn't set up for the confirmation message
for deleteRecord function. So, I fixed the code and finished the all the test cases. And, there was no big challenge or problem during testing the
test plan.
